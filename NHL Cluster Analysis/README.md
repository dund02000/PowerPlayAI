#This is a clustering analysis exercise using the KMeans algorith in Python. We are clustering all NHL players into groups using their indivudal playing statistics to determine a "playing style". We also create a roster breakdown per team to identify which type of player a team is lacking, and will use this to recommend player signings for the 202 NHL off-season.
